bayes.cpp takes in 3 textfiles as its input: train.txt, classify.txt, and output.txt.
It uses bayes theorem to determine how likely an object with a specific set of attributes will have a certain classification.
It calculates the probabilities using train.txt, and the set of attributes are provided in classify.txt. The program then outputs the answers into output.txt.
