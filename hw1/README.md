split.cpp takes a linked list of integers and recursively sort
all the integers into two separate linked list, one contains
all the odd integers and the other contains all the even integers.

ulliststr.cpp is an unrolled linked list that contains an array in
each of its nodes. For this assignment, I wrote the push_back, 
push_front, pop_back, pop_front, back, front and getValAtLoc functions
to manipulate unrolled linked list.

ulliststr_test.cpp contains the test cases for ulliststr.cpp.
